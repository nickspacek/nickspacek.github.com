&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nickspacek/cast-receiver-list&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nickspacek/cast-receiver-list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/cast/&#34;&gt;Google Cast API&lt;/a&gt;
a little bit, specifically the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/cast/chrome_sender&#34;&gt;Chrome Sender API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing any application will have in common is retrieving the list of
available senders and displaying them for the user to select from. As I
was playing with the API I decided to extract the code out into a module
and make it available for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning I was using jQuery for DOM manipulation, so the first
incaranation of the plugin uses jQuery. Since then I started playing
with AngularJS, having had only a little bit of experience with it. So
I thought it would be interesting to build a plugin for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nickspacek/cast-receiver-list&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the project page&lt;/a&gt;.
Currently, there&amp;rsquo;s only a very brief example of how to  use the plugins
and both still need lots of work. They&amp;rsquo;re mostly there for a POC and as
some sample code to get started with the Chrome Sender API.&lt;/p&gt;
